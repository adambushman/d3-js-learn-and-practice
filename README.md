# D3.js Learn and Practice

A series of JavaScript and HTML files for learning and practicing visualization techniques using the {D3} library and its other extensions.

## Description

Visualization is the crossroads of information sharing and true learning, which often translates to being the paramount step of communicating insights 
from data analysis and machine learning. I work on improving my visualization skills using D3.js and its extensions.

Within this repository you'll find JavaScript and HTML files, along with datasets and links to the resources I used to learn and practice the visualization techniques. [View these projects](https://adambushman.github.io/d3-js-learn-and-practice/) and explore them for yourself.
